<h2>DevOpsonline Lviv 2021 Divchur Khrystyna</h2>
 <p> My result of work - created a repository, followed files, learnt about integration with Github and  how it works. It was my first meeting with git and GitHub. Git gives us a possibility to follow our files and watch changes, also we have different commands that help us to do this.  I think we learn only a little bit of them).</p>
 <p> Git is like a system to manage your files, your changes and you also can cooperate with your team and other participants in the project and merge your changes, development into one big product or service. It's very suitable to create the structure and streams</p>
  <p> We have learned how to create a repo, to added files, to change them, to move and download in your local computer, also how to merge branches and gathering all of the information, how to manage your creation and view file history. We learnt how could be and what is the possible way to show the structure. And we saw the way to  develop)</p>
  <p>  Devops  is a creator), i can say also like "magic stick" for members of team and customers. They should be a very skilled person. I adore this phrase, what they say "Devops is like a culture, not role" - I suppose it is true. You should be aware of all streams at the project, cooperate, make decision and make it in a wise way. You must learn and share the experience, to support the system  and maintain custoomers and your team, and be ready take responsibility, meet the demands .</p>
  <p>  Thank you :)</p>
